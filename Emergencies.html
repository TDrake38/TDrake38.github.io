    <h1>Emergencies</h1>

    <p>Before we get into which bag would be good for which emergancy. Lets talk about what options you may want in a bag. We believe your going to want bottom commpression straps 
        adjudtible shoulder harness for thoes long walks your going to take. These make the weight of the bag distribute eveninly on your body and not bare so much of it on your shoulders.

    <h2 id="eath-tornado">Earthquakes/Tornadoes</h2>
        <p> With an earthquake or tornado comes a lot of rubble and a lot of uncertainty. You may not have a house with heat. All your food could be gone and who knows what else. In 
            the event an earthquake happens we suggest this bag.

    <h2>Floods/Tsunamis</h2>
    <p> With a flood or a tsunami usually comes a lot of water. In this case your going to want a little bit bigger of a bag to hold a few more articles of clothing.

    <h2>House/Wild Fires</h2>
    <p> When it comes to fires you will need to have this bag in an easy and accesible place. They can happen around the holidays or in the summer months when the heat is dry and there hasnt been much rain.

    <h2>Hurricane</h2>
         <p> Hurricanes are not fun. They come with a lot of wind and water. Like the flood/tsunami bag. You may need items to make a shelter if it takes your home. 
        <br>

        <p>This is a 38L bag.
        </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Water.</li>

                <li>One extra pair of socks and underwear.</li>
                <li>Two days worth of food minimum.</li>
                <li>Some type of rechargeable power bank/solar.</li>
                <li>Flash light(possibly crank).</li>
                <li>Fire starter.</li>
                <li>Some 1/4" line for hanging clothing to dry.</li>

    <h2>Winter Months</h2>
         <p>During winter months it might be good to have a few things extra packed in your bag. The temperatures get a lot lower. Here are some times that you could pick up to help with the cold.</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Sleeping bag good for below zero degrees.</li>
            <li>Tooks and whool socks (breathable material will be what helps. You dont want anything thats going to hold in moisture and make you sweat).</li>
            <li>Hot paws to help warm up your hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Warm Jacket.</li>
            <li>Gloves (I find the big mittons work best. The more space between the skin on your hands and the air the better. Figure gloves work well too for mobility but arnt as effective).</li>
            <li>Depending on much moving around your doing you may want a set of snow shoes and ski poles to help treck through snow.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </div>
