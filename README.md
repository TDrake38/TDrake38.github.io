Hello!

This is my very first project. 

This website is all about having a good bag packed if you come across an emergency. 
Across Canada there are many different types of emergencies. Some include floods, fires and winter storms. 

This website will be suggesting different bags and items to pack. Hopefully it will
help you out in a jam. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my first project.
