Hello!

This is my very pirst project. 

This website is all about having a good bag packed if you come across an emergency. 
Across Canada there are many different types of emergencies. Some include floods, fires and winter storms. 

This website will be suggesting different sizes of bags and items to pack in thoes bags. Hopefully it will
help you out in a jam. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my first project.
