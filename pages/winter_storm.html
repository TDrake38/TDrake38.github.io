            <p> During winter months it might be good to have a few things extra packed in your bag. The temperatures get a lot lower during these months and with the extra gear for winter you're going to want a bigger bag. The 75 litre Gregory Denali from MEC should have what it takes to carry your needs. Click the bag. <a href="https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5037-337/Denali-75-Backpack?colour=BK501" target= "_blank"><img src="../images/bag-icon2.png" class="bag-icon"></a></p>
