    <h1>Emergency Preparedness Bags</h1>

    <div>
    <h2>Emergencies</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Before we get into which bag would be good for which emergancy. Lets talk about what options you may want in a bag. Your going to want bottom commpression straps to take the weight and 
        adjudtible shoulder harness for thoes long walks your going to take. These distribute the weight eveninly on your body so you don't bare so much of it on your shoulders. You may want a bag
         with some type of rain cover depending on where you live. Also anything under a 35L bag may not be enough to get you through a long period. That being said on to some essentials.
        
    </p>
    <p>No matter which emergency happens to you. Every EPB (Emergency Preparedness Bag) should include the followng:</p>
    <div>

    <h2 id="eath-tornado">Earthquakes/Tornadoes</h2>
        <p> Lets talk earthquakes and tornados. When these disasters happen there tends to be lots of rubble. Houses usually take a lot of damage and 
            may not even make it through the event. In this case we reccomend this bag below with a few extra items.

    <h2>House/Wild Fires</h2>

    <h2>Hurricane</h2>
         <p> Hurricanes are not fun. They come with a lot of wind and water. Like the flood/tsunami bag. You may need items to make a shelter if it takes your home. 
        <div style="text-align: center;">

        <p>This is a 38L bag.

    <h2 id="wm">Winter Months</h2>
         <p>During winter months it might be good to have a few things extra packed in your bag. The temperatures get a lot lower. Here are some times that you could pick up to help with the cold.</p>

    <div>
        <ul class="inventory">
            <li>Sleeping bag good for below zero degrees.</li>
            <li>Tooks and whool socks (breathable material will be what helps. You dont want anything thats going to hold in moisture and make you sweat).</li>
            <li>Hot paws to help warm up your hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Warm Jacket.</li>
            <li>Gloves (I find the big mittons work best. The more space between the skin on your hands and the air the better. Figure gloves work well too for mobility but arnt as effective).</li>
            <li>Depending on much moving around your doing you may want a set of snow shoes and ski poles to help treck through snow.</li>
            
        </ul>
