    <p>Before we get into which bag would be good for which emergancy. Lets talk about what options you may want in a bag. Your going to want bottom commpression straps to take the weight and 
        adjudtible shoulder harness for thoes long walks your going to take. These distribute the weight eveninly on your body so you don't bare so much of it on your shoulders. You may want a bag
         with some type of rain cover depending on where you live. Also anything under a 35L bag may not be enough to get you through a long period. That being said on to some essentials.
