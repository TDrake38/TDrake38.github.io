    <p>Before we get into which bag would be good for which emergancy. Lets talk about what options you may want in a bag. Your probably going to want bottom commpression straps and an adjustible shoulder harness for thoes long walks your going to take. These distribute the weight eveninly on your body so you wont bare so much of it on your shoulders. You may want a bag with some type of rain cover depending on if you live in an area that gets a lot. Also any bag under a 35 litres may not have enough space to hold all your gear.
