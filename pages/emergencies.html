            Before we get into which bag would be good for which emergency. Let's talk about what options you may want in a bag. You're probably going to want bottom compression straps and an adjustable shoulder harness for those long walks you're going to take. These distribute the weight evenly on your body so you won't bare so much of it on your shoulders and a bag with some type of rain cover to keep it dry. Also any bag under 35 litres may not have enough space to hold all your gear.
